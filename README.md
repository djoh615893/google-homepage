This will be the first real project that I am doing in The Odin Project online coding program. I spent the day working through the tutorials and videos in the page leading up to this. I did a little guided tutorial that led me to make an
artificial webpage so that I could build out the HTML and then add some CSS elements. This will be really fun to work on in the next day or two.

Been hunting down information online, working from scratch. Been putting in code and seeing if it works. So far I got a logo and a search bar on the screen, and everything is sitting on the left side. I linked my CSS document and put in some
code, but nothing happened yet. I deleted all of that and now I am hunting for more information to figure this out.
